# Color picker guessing game

## Possible future changes, a note:
* Change the background colors of the header and the color grid to scrivener colors
* Play with the border radius of the squares. Maybe circles?
* Add a timer.

## What I learned
* br tag creates a LINE BREAK. Super important, but not necessarily a good design choice. Useful for a cosmetic quick fix.
* visibility: "hidden"; is better than display: "none"; for this website because it doesn't make the remaining colors float to the left to take up that spot. In other words there is still space being occupied on the page by the hidden element.
* Javascript math functions that generate random numbers and functions that chop off the numbers after the decimal: floor().
* Transition CSS property. Used in this project to slow down the change of CSS properties;
