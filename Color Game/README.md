# Color picker guessing game

## What I learned
* visibility: "hidden" is better than display: "none" for this website because it doesn't make the remaining colors float to the left to take up that spot. In other words there is still space being occupied on the page by the hidden element.
* Javascript math functions that generate random numbers and functions that chop off the numbers after the decimal: floor().
