# About
This is a repo where I'll probably store any and all of the websites that I create. If I feel proud about a website I'll probably add it
here in a subfolder and create a separate repo for it. As of right now (3/24/2019) I have only utilized basic HTML and CSS in my websites. 
And, I plan on learning and using REACT, javascript, DOM manipulation, etc.
