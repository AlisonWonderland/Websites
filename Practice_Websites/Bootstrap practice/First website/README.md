# What I learned
Learned that Bootstrap is a CSS framework, in other words Bootstrap is a library of ready to use CSS stylings that you can include in your 
website so that you don't have to start from scratch. You can modify the stylings by adding a <style> tag in side a head tag. Jumbotrons 
are primarily used when you want to catch the attention of the website visitor to a certain piece of content, like a sale or new product.
Also learned that containers are one of the most important parts of Bootstrap because its needed to use Bootstrap's grid system. More on the 
grid system later
