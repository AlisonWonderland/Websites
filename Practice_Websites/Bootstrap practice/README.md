# About
This folder contains all the websites that I've created for the Web Developer Bootcamp course on Udemy, as well as others I've created to play around with Bootstrap. If I feel proud about a website you'll probably see it again in a separate folder.

## Quick notes
* div container class: Centers everything that is within the div tag. This pops up a lot.
* divs are used to group up HTML elements and apply CSS to them.
* Jquery cdn link must come before bootstraps javascript link because it relies on jquery.
* The hamburger needs jquery and javascript to work.
* div "collapse navbar-collapse" is used to create the hamburger. Wrap the div around the content you want to put in the hamburger. Check out the navbar folder for more info
