# Gallery website
Website excerise that uses a navbar, jumbotron and the grid system.

## INCLUDE SCREENSHOT


## What I learned/did
* More practice with navbars. Understood how to take an example navbar and modify it to my liking. 
* Remember again that navbar-collapse creates the little hamburger when the website is in mobile size.
* Learned about thumbnails which shapes the images into a picture frame.
* Ctrl + D is SUPER USEFUL for selecting classes of the same name.
* Glyphicons are sometimes free icons that you can use to include in your websites provided by Bootstrap.
* Span tag is for adding a bit of style to some text or to add a "hook" like the camera icon next to the website title.
* To change size of Font Awesome icon, you use font-size.
