# Gallery website
Website excerise that uses a navbar, jumbotron and the grid system.

# REMEMBER TO ADD SCREENSHOT

## What I learned/did
* More practice with navbars. Understood how to take an example navbar and modify it to my liking. 
* Remember again that navbar-collapse creates the little hamburger when the website is in mobile size.
* Learned about thumbnails
