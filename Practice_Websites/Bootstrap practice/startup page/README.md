## What I Learned/Did
* background-size: Fills out width and height of screen, to fit image on screen.
* background-position: To center image.
* Use % to make website responsive
* rgba(): used for opacity.
* Use 'height: 100%'' on html tag to make body take up the entire window.
* Text shadow: to add shadow effect on text.
