# About
This is a simple website that has a 3x3 grid of black and wide pictures. It is supposed to emulate a photographers blog.

## What I learned by creating this
### CSS properties
* Float: Will positon an element in the position that you put it in and position other elements to the side of it. In this example all images will start at the leftmost position on the webpage that is available. When no more space is left on a row, then they'll start under the row.
