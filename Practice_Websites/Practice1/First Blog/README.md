# About
This is supposed to be a simple mockup of a blog website. This is an exercise of a Web Dev course I'm taking on Udemy.

## What I learned while adding to this blog
* hr element: Horizontal line that splits paragraphs. Meant to be used when the following paragraphs shifts to another topic/story.
* iframe element: Element used for embedding a website into another website. Used for things like inserting a youtube video into your website. 

## Thoughts on the exercise
Probably the best way to wrap up the css portion of the course. Creating a blog is something that I want to do for one of my serious web projects and now because of the exercise I have a basic outline of one. Also this exercise was great because I got a chance to reinforce my understanding of the box model concept, was encouraged to put some effort into picking out a color scheme and learned of a new tag to layout a website.
