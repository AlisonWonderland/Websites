<h1> For all the time I see </h1>

<h3>April 4th 2019 1:00 pm</h3>
<h2> My, its my first blog post. And some review </h2>
<p class="first-paragraph">I'm currently reviewing the 1st week material for ENGL 101(Critical Theory) as well as my other classes. So far I've learned that a critical theory is a theory that a person comes up with when they believe a social or political policy is oppressive/limiting. </p>

<p>This theory usually involves way of reversing or freeing people from that policy. An example of this is Karl Marx's critical therory against capitalism, communism. Now I don't know much about communism, but I have some idea that he thought that capitalism restricted the freedom that people deserve, so he came up with the Communist Manifesto. A manifesto laying out what an ideology that would free people. Critical theories help people unravel societies and improve/change them how they see fit, however this presents a bind. And that is that this new society will restrict and mold people to specific cognitives, just like previous socieities. So in essence critical theories help us escape one "oppressive" society and then moves us to another.</p>

<p>Now why we seek to do this is another question and one that we'll probably won't discuss in this class. Though its interesting to think that it could just be "evolution" or just our nature to always seek improvement or peer pressure. Now in CS141(Intermediate Algorithms and Data Structures) we did review of Big O notation and Big &Theta; notation. Nothing new. In operating systems, I learned that OS' abstracts many things like memory allocation and i/o port connections so that programs can be made portable across multiple hardware systems. Not only that but OS' provide a user interface. So far some basic ideas about OS'. I'm thinking of OS' as law enforcement. OS settle disputes over resource allocation between programs by letting them have access to it at the same time like RAM maybe or maybe letting one program have access to it and then after some time letting the other have access. Actually this in particular sounds like divorce court when the divorcees fight for custody over the kids. My understanding is pretty rough, hopefully by the weekend my knowledge will solidify.</p>

<h2>A mind dump</h2>
<p class="first-paragraph">Just going to use this post to write down everything I've "learned" in my study period. Will probably be doing this for future blog posts since I don't know what else to write about</p>
<p>So just did some OS review. OS' have privleged access to hardware, it makes sense since you don't want programs to worry about i/o connections or memory allocation. And the way that programs get access to these resources are system calls. When a system call is invoked the program enters kernel mode and then when the kernel is done the program goes back to user mode. And all these means that the hardware, usually the cpu needs a way of telling the operating system what kind of privileges each process has. So we want the hardware to help the os with events in software and i/o. We also want to be given access to registers, control this access to processes. OS' "sleep". Meaning they not running consistenly when the pc is on. They only respond to events and go back to sleep after some time, same power consumption maybe even saves some RAM or CPU usage, idk about the previous. Also don't expect all the words to be spelled correctly. Implement a word corrector would be pretty nice.</p>
<p>
Making this neater. so hardware must support OS and user mode, they do this by have a mode bit in a protected control register. pcr. If the user program executes a system call the os gets alerted by a TRAP and then gives that program high priority. traps occur when a proccess divides by zero or accesses invalid memory. This is one way that OS' are alerted when a system call occurs. So its something that is expected. an interrupt on the other hand is caused by hardware, this is unexpected. To many ways that it can happen.</p>

<h2>Short and sweet</h2>
<p class="first-paragraph">Currently the electricity is out and I'm just typing a bit to pass the time. Might read some nosleep afterwards.</p>
<p>Clarity of mind is something I need to works towards. Which is why I'll start to write consistently in this blog or journal, whatever it actually is. Though I don't think I'll be able to write that much with the quarter work load I have. I see if there is a spell checker plug in for sublime, it'll be useful for this website. Being able to post on this website without actually typing in the actual html file is going to be exciting. No more having to right click the html file and then open with sublime. Lets go back to reading the economist writing guide. Speaking of which, hopefully blog posts a year from now will be coherrent and elegant. Thats one goal.</p>

<h2>Posting at the same time</h2>
<p class="first-paragraph">I wish there was a way to copy text easier in sublime like in vim. It would be nice to copy using keyboard only. Virtualization is a way of tricking a process into thinking that it has accesss to all the resources the computer has to offer. This makes managing resources for the OS easier because it has a way of giving the processes resourses all at the same time. </p>

<p>Need to practice for 141, the class is going to be brutal if I don't. Created a good schedule for summer and senior year. Lets hope I can take all those classes at the same time. Dad put a hammock in the backyard this past Sunday and its something I never would've guessed would be so enjoyable. I like laying there watching the bugs fly near the bush and the birds pirched on the branches, occasionally glancing at me. I wonder what Caliman thinks when I lay in it. All he does is sit down right under the hammock or near the side where I can reach down and pet him.</p>

<p>Remember that fireworks barrel dream? What happened in it?</p>

<p>We approached this modern white tech centric mansion and we were with two other people, one gal and one guy. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, these barrels are launched towards us. The dream cuts to a view where we can see the guy near one of the barrels and then... you know what happens then. 2 pieces, remember? </p>

<p>I wonder what potential readers might think of these posts, these ramblings. Its intentional I have to say. I type what I'm thinking and it so happens that my mind wanders quite a bit, each minute. Make a post tomorrow. Tired, going to bed.</p>

<h2>School and thoughts</h2>
<p class="first-paragraph"> Was really hoping to continue the trend of spending time on personal projects, but school is too much sometimes. </p>

<p>Even if I have free time I'm usually not in the mood to work on outside projects. Especially after spending a good while on a homework problem and not getting anywhere. These algorithm classes are the bane of my existence. Also I'm definetly not going to be writing to this blog as often as I thought. Or maybe I am. Was initially treating this blog as a sort of journal, but now I'm only going to type when I really want to get something out there. Like record my thoughts like right now. Doing this every once in a while should give me a good perspective on how I was doing in the past. I might also write some stories. I've been trying to start up my creative muscle since I haven't been openly creative since art classs in high school. Reading these posts are going to be a pain in the future, there is no coherence. Which is ironic because I think in a previous post I said that I was going to improve my writing. To do that I need more practice, so maybe I'll starting posting frequently after all. </p>

<p>I just realized that I should be using paragraphs more often.</p>

<p>Its pretty hard to see how my blog is going to look since I'm just typing in Sublime. Could open it up in Chrome. Don't want to obviously. </p>

<p>Recently I've made a habit to look at other websites other than <a href="https://www.reddit.com" target="_blank">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv" target="_blank">Twitch </a>. I've started to go to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank">Hackernews</a>. Its sorta like Reddit in the sense that you can post something and it pops up on the main page of the website and you can comment and upvote posts. Though it doesn't have a subcommunity aspect, its posts revolve around thought provoking, interesting articles with a scientific focus, among other things. One <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/06/health/conference-room-air.html" target="_blank">article</a> that stood out to me was one about carbon dioxide levels and its correlation to the reduction of peoples problem solving and decision making skills. Cutting blog for now.</p>
