<h1> For all the time I see </h1>

<h3>April 4th 2019 1:00 pm</h3>
<h2> My, its my first blog post. And some review </h2>
<p class="first-paragraph">I'm currently reviewing the 1st week material for ENGL 101(Critical Theory) as well as my other classes. So far I've learned that a critical theory is a theory that a person comes up with when they believe a social or political policy is oppressive/limiting. </p>

<p>This theory usually involves way of reversing or freeing people from that policy. An example of this is Karl Marx's critical therory against capitalism, communism. Now I don't know much about communism, but I have some idea that he thought that capitalism restricted the freedom that people deserve, so he came up with the Communist Manifesto. A manifesto laying out what an ideology that would free people. Critical theories help people unravel societies and improve/change them how they see fit, however this presents a bind. And that is that this new society will restrict and mold people to specific cognitives, just like previous socieities. So in essence critical theories help us escape one "oppressive" society and then moves us to another.</p>

<p>Now why we seek to do this is another question and one that we'll probably won't discuss in this class. Though its interesting to think that it could just be "evolution" or just our nature to always seek improvement or peer pressure. Now in CS141(Intermediate Algorithms and Data Structures) we did review of Big O notation and Big &Theta; notation. Nothing new. In operating systems, I learned that OS' abstracts many things like memory allocation and i/o port connections so that programs can be made portable across multiple hardware systems. Not only that but OS' provide a user interface. So far some basic ideas about OS'. I'm thinking of OS' as law enforcement. OS settle disputes over resource allocation between programs by letting them have access to it at the same time like RAM maybe or maybe letting one program have access to it and then after some time letting the other have access. Actually this in particular sounds like divorce court when the divorcees fight for custody over the kids. My understanding is pretty rough, hopefully by the weekend my knowledge will solidify.</p>

<p>No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out.</p>

<p>Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. In your world you have total and absolute power. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long.</p>

<p>Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? That easy. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. This is the fun part</p>

<p>Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. You gotta think like a tree. Trees grow however makes them happy. There comes a nice little fluffer. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you.</p>

<p>That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. The least little bit can do so much. Happy painting, God bless.</p>

<p>Look at them little rascals. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are.</p>

<p>The light is your friend. Preserve it. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. This is truly an almighty mountain. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint.</p>

<p>Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Let's get crazy. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world.</p>
