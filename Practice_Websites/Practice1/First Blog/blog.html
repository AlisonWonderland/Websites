<p>No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out.</p>

<p>Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. In your world you have total and absolute power. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long.</p>

<p>Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? That easy. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. This is the fun part</p>

<p>Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. You gotta think like a tree. Trees grow however makes them happy. There comes a nice little fluffer. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you.</p>

<p>That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. The least little bit can do so much. Happy painting, God bless.</p>

<p>Look at them little rascals. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are.</p>

<p>The light is your friend. Preserve it. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. This is truly an almighty mountain. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint.</p>

<p>Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Let's get crazy. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world.</p>
