# About
This a very basic website used to play around with the concept of the Box Model.

## What I learned
Learned that each HTML element is considered a box and CSS can change the characterstics of these boxes. There are 4 components to
the box model:

### Content
Self explanatory, its the text or picture of the element. Think of it as the painting.

### Padding
This the space between the content and the border. Think of it as the white space between the painting and the brown border below:

### Border
A line that separates each box, like the brown frame above.

### Margin
The amount of empty space around each box.
