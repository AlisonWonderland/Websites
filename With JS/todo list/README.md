# Simple Todo List website
This is a todo list website that supports three commands: new(To add a todo), list(To print out todos) and quit. It gets input from the user using prompts and stores the todos in an array. The todos are then printed out below "Your Todos:".

## What I learned/did
* Gained some practice with javascript, specifically with using array methods like forEach and splice.
