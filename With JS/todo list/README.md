# Simple Todo List website
This is a todo list website that supports three commands: new(To add a todo), list(To print out todos) and quit. It gets input from the user using prompts and stores the todos in an array. The todos are printed out in the developer console.

Note: You have to refresh the page after opening the dev console, otherwise it won't work for some reason.

## What I learned/did
* Gained some practice with javascript, specifically with using array methods like forEach and splice.
