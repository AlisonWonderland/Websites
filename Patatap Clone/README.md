# Patatap Clone
Website inspired by https://www.patatap.com/

It uses [Paper.js](http://paperjs.org/) to create the circles and the related animations that are created when a user enters a key. To generate the sounds, I used [howler.js](https://howlerjs.com/).

It uses almost all the sounds that are used in the original website, with the exception of two sounds for the 't' and 'z' keys which I got from a drum kit.

The original website sounds can be found here:
