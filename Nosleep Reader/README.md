## Todo 
|Navbar| at the top with 'Nosleep Reader', maybe fixed to the top. Have option to unfix it. On the left side have a hamburger that hides/shows the top 10 stories. Labeled with numbers and a part of the title. Right side have the dark mode/ light mode buttons.

|Content/story| Keep it centered with some margin.


|Bottom| Source code link with a github link using a fontawesome icon.

AFTER:

Add a feature that takes in a link and formats that story back. It would be a link in the navbar and that link would go to a page with a form/input box and it would return the formatted page.

---STYLING===
Dim navbar bar as we scroll down and brighten it up when we hover over it.
For light mode to white background black text. Dark mode do black background, gold text? maybe a dim white? Make sure the github icon changes color too.

Hardest part: Navbar.
