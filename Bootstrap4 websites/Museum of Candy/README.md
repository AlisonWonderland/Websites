# What I learned/did
* Learned what the 'aria-label' attribute does from bootstrap. It provides a description for screenreaders.
* Changing font colors when hovering over links.
* Introduced to media queries.
* Played around with the bootstrap classes.
* Bootstrap classes on order. Examples:
```html
order-1
order-md-2
```
These classes will determine which elements go on top or start first in a row.
* Media queries. Which are css properties that apply styles based on certain values like window size.
