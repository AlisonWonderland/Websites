# About
Practice website I created to try out a video background website. Going to be a precursor for the Kaliman website

## What I learned
* vh and vw (viewport height and viewport width): Image units where the amount specifies how much of the window height or width it will take up in percentages.
* position absolute: Elements with this property will stay where they're placed, but will not be apart of the 'flow'. Meaning that other elements can overlap with it. These elements will also be 'absolute' in terms of their parents if their parents have 'relative' for position value. Otherwise, they'll default to the body.
* z-index: can be used to layer things. Needs 'position relative' to work.
